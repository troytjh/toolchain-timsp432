MSP432 GCC Support Package v1.2.0.0
===================================
03/13/2017

    !Important Notice!:
    MSP432 GCC Support package is complete debugger and open source C/C++ compiler toolchain for building and debugging embedded applications based on MSP432 microcontrollers. 
    MSP432 GCC Support package supports Windows, Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) or Mac OS X environments.
    The ARM GCC Compiler is owned and maintained by ARM. Therefore, the ARM GCC compiler is not provided within the MSP432 GCC Support Package. 
    While the TI package includes the examples and other collateral files, users can download the GCC and GDB binaries from the following location: https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
    This package has been tested with:
    - GCC ARM Embedded Compiler v4_9-2015q3-20150921
    - GCC ARM Embedded Compiler v5_4-2016q2-20160622
    - GCC ARM Embedded Compiler v6_2-2016q4-20161216
    
    Components:
    - MSP432 header and support files (v3.0.0):
        = CMSIS Core v5.0
        = Header files
        = Startup files
        = Linker files
        = MSP432 FlashDLL
    - XDS Emulation Software Package including GDB agent (v6.0.579.0):
        = Support of automated firmware update for XDS debug probes
    - Five examples (based on MSPWare v3.50.00.02)

    Bug fixes:
    - Update example codes
    - Fixing issues with GCC startup file
    
    Known limitations:
    - For flash code, only hardware breakpoints are supported (use 'hbreak' command to set breakpoint)

MSP432 GCC Support Package v1.1.0.1
===================================

    While the TI package includes the examples and other collateral files, users can download the GCC and GDB binaries from the following location: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded.
    This package has been tested with GCC ARM Embedded Compiler v5_4-2016q2-20160622.
    
    Components:
    - MSP432 header and support files (v2.2.1):
        = CMSIS Core v4.5
        = Header files
        = Startup files
        = Linker files
        = MSP432 FlashDLL
    - XDS Emulation Software Package including GDB agent (v6.0.407.3):
        = Support of XDS110 and XDS200 debug probes
        = Support Linux 64-bit
    - Five examples (based on MSPWare v3.30.00.18)

    Bug fixes:
    - HW breakpoints can be hit (hbreak command)
    - Implementation of single file weak interrupt solution
    
    Known limitations:
    - GDB agent does not perform a firmware update automatically (navigate to emulation/common/uscif/XDS* to manually update the debug probe)
    - For flash code, only hardware breakpoints are supported (use 'hbreak' command to set breakpoint)
