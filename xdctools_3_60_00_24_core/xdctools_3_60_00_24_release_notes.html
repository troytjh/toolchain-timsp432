<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>RTSC / XDC (eXpanDed C) is a standard for reusable software components, 
optimized for real-time embedded systems. RTSC components have hardware-neutral 
formal interfaces, are configurable offline to optimize memory and performance, 
and support custom automation in the development environment via a scripting 
language.</p>
<p>The XDCtools product includes the following components: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Core (<code>xdc.*</code>)</b> -
the <code><b>xdc</b></code> and <code><b>xs</b></code> command line utilities for 
building packages and executing scripts respectively; packages that implement 
the RTSC standard;</li>
<li><b>User tools (<code>xdc.tools.*</code>)</b>
- command-line and graphical utilities for working with packages and
repositories;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse
(</span><b><code>eclipse</code></b><span style="font-weight: bold;">)</span>
- A set of integration plugins for RTSC for the eclipse platform.
These plugins are leveraged by Code Composer Studio (CCS) to provide
support for RTSC content in an integrated development environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Whats_New">What's New</a></h2>
<p>This release includes a preview implementation of "C ROV": the ability 
  to add ROV support for arbitrary C libraries without having to create a
  RTSC module.  For more information see <a target="_blank"
                                            href="https://confluence.itg.ti.com/display/TargetContent/ROV+for+C+Modules">ROV
    for C Modules</a>.
</p>
<p>In addition, this release includes several significant improvements
 to the ROV2 user interface: it's now possible to </p>
<ul>
  <li>create custom tables from one or more table cells and save as a
    dashboard,</li>
  <li>add custom cells that are functions of existing table cells,
    plot their values, and trigger actions based on their value,</li>
  <li>save and restore all of ROV's local storage to an external file
    (allowing one to import all ROV settings from one workspace into
    another),</li>
  <li>use crtl-arrow keys to bring views to the foreground, and</li>
  <li>set the default font to be fixed-width</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, this release includes an update from GNU Make 3.81 to 4.2.</p>

href="https://jira.itg.ti.com/projects/XDCTOOLS/versions/38047">here</a>.
</p>
<p><span style="color:red"><b>Note:</b> XDCtools 3.55.x (and greater)
    for Windows targets purely 64-bit distributions for of Windows.
    As a result, this release requires a 64-bit Windows host.  If you
    need to use XDCtools on a 32-bit Windows host, you must use
    XDCtools 3.51.x (or below).</span></p>

<p><a href="#XDC_TOP">back to top</a></p>
<hr/>
<h2><a name="Compatibility">Upgrade and Compatibility
    Information</a></h2>
XDCtools 3.60.x has four significant compatibility requirements:
<ul>
  <li>
    Starting with 3.60.x, XDCtools requires the use of a C99
    conforming toolchain.  C99 requires <tt>NULL</tt> to be
    defined in the standard C header <tt>stddef.h</tt> and,
    since this header is included by <tt>xdc/std.h</tt>,
    <tt>xdc/std.h</tt> no longer explicitly defines
    <tt>NULL</tt>.  As a result, the precise definition of
    <tt>NULL</tt> <i>may now vary between different compiler
      toolchains</i>,
  </li>
  <li>
    if you are using a Windows host, it must be a 64-bit version of Windows,
  </li>
  <li>
    if you are using a Windows host <i>and</i> you
    are using a version of CCS before 9.0.x, you must install a
    distribution of XDCtools that includes its own 64-bit JRE, and finally
  </li>
  <li>
    packages built using any version of XDCtools prior to 3.50.00 must
    be rebuilt using 3.50.00 (or above) before they can be used with
    this release.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Composer Studio (CCS)</h3>
  <p>XDCtools 3.60 must only be used in CCS 7.1.x (or above).</p> 
  <p><span style="color:red">In order to use XDCtools 3.60 in Windows
      CCS versions before 9.0.x, you must install the distribution of
      XDCtools that includes a 64-bit version of the JRE (because
      earlier releases of CCS only include a 32-bit JRE)</span>.</p> 
  <p>XDCtools 3.30 releases (and later) are no longer released in an installer,
    they are simply provided as <tt>.zip</tt> files which can be extracted
    into any directory that CCS uses to discover new products
    (e.g., <tt>c:/ti</tt>).</p>
  <p><strong>Note for Windows users:</strong> When you unzip an
    XDCtools release using Windows Explorer simply double click
    on the <tt>.zip</tt> file and drag the single top-level folder it
    contains to the folder containing <tt>ccsv6/</tt> (typically
    <tt>c:/ti</tt>).  If, instead, you right-click the <tt>.zip</tt>
    file and select "Extract All ...", Windows Explorer adds the
    name of the zip file itself to the default output folder.
    <em>Do not use this output name</em>.  You must extract the
    <em>contents</em> of the zip file into, say, <tt>c:/ti</tt>, 
    <em>not</em> a new folder named after the zip file itself.</p>

<h3>Deleted Content</h3>
  <p>Beginning with the 3.31 release, all embedded targets and platforms
  have been removed.  They are now delivered with middleware products, such
  as <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-rtos">TI-RTOS</a>, that have
  dependencies on specific targets and platforms.</p>
<h3>Package Compatibility</h3>
  <p><b>Package internal files</b>: All generated package internal files
    are backwards compatible starting from XDCtools 3.20.  So, packages
    created using XDCtools 3.20 or later can be consumed using
    this release.  However, changes to the generated C module headers
    requires that packages created with this release that
    contain non-metaonly modules cannot be used with XDCtools 
    releases earlier than XDCtools 3.50.x.  This includes the
    <code>xdc.runtime</code> package.
    See <a href="http://104.154.111.176/docs-tip/XDCtools_Internal_Version_Numbers">XDCtools Internal Version Numbers</a> for additional details.</p>

  <p><b>Generated Module headers</b>: All generated module headers have
    been changed to support "const clean" configuration files (see
    <a target="_blank"
       href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=506855">Bug
    506855</a>)
    Because of this, all non-meta-only modules built with earlier
    releases must be rebuilt using XDCtools 3.50 (or above) in order
    to use the <code>xdc.runtime</code> provided by this release.  As a result,
    <span style="color:red">XDCtools 3.50 (or above) can't be 
    used with packages containing non-meta-only modules that were built
    using XDCtools 3.32 or earlier</span>. In particular:
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;color:red">SYS/BIOS 6.46 packages
    can't be used with XDCtools 3.50 (or above); you must use SYS/BIOS
    6.50.00 (or above)
  </p>

  <p><b>Package-specific APIs</b>: Each package
    has a compatibility key defined in its <b><code>package.xdc</code></b>
    specification file.  No package compatibility keys were changed in this
    release.
  </p>
  <p>Please note that the package compatibility keys are
    independent of XDCtools product release numbers (described in 
    <a href="#Version">Versioning</a> below).  Package compatibility keys:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Enable tooling to identify incompatibilities between components, and</li>
    <li>Convey end-user requirements when re-integrating specific components.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Package compatibility keys are composed of 4 comma-delimited numbers -
    M, S, R, P - where: </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>M = Major
	-</b> A difference in M indicates a break in compatibility. The 
      package consumer is required to re-write its source code in order to
      use the package.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>S = Source 
	-</b> A difference in S indicates source compatibility.
      The package consumer's source code doesn't require change, but
      <i>does</i> require a recompile.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>R = Radix
	-</b> A difference in R indicates an introduction of new features, but 
      compatibility with previous interfaces is not broken. If libraries are 
      provided by the package, an application must re-link with the
      new libraries, but is not required to recompile its source.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>P = Patch
	-</b>A difference in P indicates that only bugs
      have been fixed in the latest package and no new features have
      been introduced.  If libraries are provided by the package, an 
      application must re-link with the new libraries, but is not
      required to recompile its source.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr/>
<h2><a name="Device_Support">Device Support</a></h2>
  <p>Starting with release 3.31, XDCtools no longer includes specific embedded device support. As a result, users must either use another product (such as <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-rtos">TI-RTOS</a>),
    which includes any necessary device support or explicitly adds a repository
    containing the desired device support to the package path of their projects.</p>
